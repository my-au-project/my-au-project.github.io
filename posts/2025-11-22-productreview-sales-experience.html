      <h2>Key takeaways</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Builders may request reviews shortly after deposit and pre-construction starts.</li>
        <li>The review process can involve an internal step before a public review.</li>
        <li>Providing honest feedback helps acknowledge good sales experiences.</li>
        <li>Reviews are optional and shared later in the process.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <p>
      After paying the deposit and officially entering the pre-construction stage,
      we were asked by the builder to provide a review of our sales experience.
      The request focused on how our experience was and how likely we would be
      to recommend the builder to a friend, rated on a scale from 1 to 10.
    </p>

    <h2>Internal review</h2>

    <p>
      The internal review is used within the builder's organisation which appeared
      to be aimed at measuring sales consultant performance and customer
      satisfaction.
    </p>

    <p>
      We had a very positive experience with our sales consultant at the time.
      She was helpful, approachable, and supportive during the early stages of
      our journey, so we were more than happy to write a genuine and appreciative
      review reflecting that experience.
    </p>

    <h2>Public ProductReview request</h2>

    <p>
      After some time, we were then invited to submit a public review on
      <strong>ProductReview.com.au</strong>. This step was separate
      from the internal feedback we had already provided.
    </p>

    <p>
      The public review allowed us to share our experience more broadly and give
      visibility to the sales stage of the process, which we felt was important,
      especially for other first-home builders doing their research.
    </p>

    <h2>Our perspective</h2>

    <p>
      At this stage of the journey, the review reflected our experience with the
      sales process only. It was written honestly, based on how things felt at
      that moment in time, without knowing how later stages would unfold.
