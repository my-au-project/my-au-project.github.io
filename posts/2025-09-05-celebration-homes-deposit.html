    </section>

    <p>
      This meeting with Celebration Homes was an important one for us. The goal
      was to go through the design, review the itemised costs, and pay the deposit to start the pre-construction process.
    </p>

    <h2>Why timing mattered</h2>
    <p>
      At this point, our situation was clear and well planned:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Land finance settlement expected in February 2026</li>
      <li>Land titles estimated for March - April 2026</li>
      <li>Overseas holiday planned for late February and all of March</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Because of this, our goal was to complete pre-construction by
      mid-January to February 2026, so everything would be ready to go as soon
      as the land titled. Given it was only September, we felt we had plenty of
      time, especially when factoring in the December holiday period.
    </p>

    <h2>Design review and itemised costs</h2>
    <p>
      During the meeting, we revisited the floor plan changes we had previously
      discussed and went through the cost of each item in the pre-construction
      contract.
    </p>

    <p>
      This was the first time we really understood what everything would cost,
      line by line. Having this visibility meant we could pick and choose what
      to include based on the budget we had allocated for the build.
    </p>

    <p>
      It felt reassuring to finally have numbers instead of estimates and to
      make decisions with confidence.
    </p>

    <h2>Paying the deposit</h2>
    <p>
      After confirming that everything looked correct, we proceeded with paying
      the deposit to officially start the process.
    </p>

    <p>
      We left the appointment feeling excited, knowing the next steps would
      involve selecting cabinetry styles, colours, flooring, and other finishes.
      It really felt like things were moving forward.
    </p>

    <h2>An early oversight</h2>
    <p>
      One thing we missed at the time was asking for copies of the contract and
      other documents we signed. We assumed these would be sent through via
      email afterward, which looking back was an oversight on our part.
    </p>

    <div class="callout">
      Always ask for copies of signed documents before leaving the appointment.
    </div>

    <h2>What happened next</h2>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, Celebration Homes did not follow through with the process
      as expected. While we were anticipating progress through to February,
      nothing moved forward.
    </p>

    <p>
      This ultimately led us to reassess our options and explore other builders.
      We cover this in a later post:
