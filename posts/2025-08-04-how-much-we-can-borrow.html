  <h2>Key takeaways</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Speak to a mortgage broker early to understand realistic borrowing power.</li>
    <li>Have a clear plan and timeline before looking for land or builders.</li>
    <li>Loan structure matters — we preferred a major bank with multiple offsets.</li>
    <li>Expect to provide income, ID, and liability documents upfront.</li>
    <li>This step sets the foundation for everything that follows.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
    <p>
      Before doing anything else, we wanted to understand how much we could
      realistically borrow. Since we weren’t first home buyers and were planning
      to upsize and build, getting clarity early was important.
    </p>

    <h2>Meeting with a mortgage broker</h2>
    <p>
      We contacted a mortgage broker and arranged a meeting to talk through our
      plans. Our goal was to understand our borrowing capacity and whether our
      timeline was realistic.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our rough plan was to:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Check how much we could borrow</li>
      <li>Secure a block of land</li>
      <li>Sign a building contract</li>
      <li>Move out of our current home and into the new build</li>
      <li>Sell our existing property once we had moved</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Ideally, we wanted to secure land within the next 3–5 months, start
      building as soon as possible, move in within around two months of
      completion, and sell our old home shortly after.
    </p>

    <h2>Loan preferences and questions</h2>
    <p>
      During the meeting, we discussed our preference for using a major bank and
      having a loan structure with multiple offset accounts.
    </p>

    <p>
      We also asked about:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Potential taxes we might incur</li>
      <li>Other fees involved in building and lending</li>
      <li>Different loan types that could suit our situation</li>
      <li>Whether the broker had trusted builders to recommend</li>
      <li>Private certifying authorities</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout">
      This conversation gave us confidence that our plan was achievable and
      highlighted a few things we hadn’t considered yet.
    </div>

    <h2>Documents requested</h2>
    <p>
      To assess our financial position and prepare lending scenarios, the broker
      asked us to provide the following:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Recent bank statements</li>
      <li>Driver’s licence</li>
      <li>Passport</li>
      <li>Medicare card</li>
      <li>HECS and HELP statements</li>
      <li>Most recent two payslips</li>
    </ul>
