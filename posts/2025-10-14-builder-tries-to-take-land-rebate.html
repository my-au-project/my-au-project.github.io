      <h2>Key takeaways</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Land and build contracts should be treated as separate agreements.</li>
        <li>Read every document carefully before signing, even if it seems minor.</li>
        <li>If something feels unclear or risky, pause and ask for clarification.</li>
        <li>Get opinions from your broker, developer, or legal adviser if needed.</li>
        <li>You are not obligated to sign documents that are unclear or unnecessary.</li>

    <p>
      Our land contract included a buyer's rebate of <strong>$10,000 AUD (inclusive of GST)</strong>,
      which was to be deducted from the total land price upon settlement.
      This rebate was clearly documented in our land contract with the developer.
    </p>

    <p>
      At some point during pre-construction, our builder requested that the rebate
      be paid to them directly by the developer and reflected as an itemised credit
      in our building contract. This immediately raised concerns for us.
    </p>

    <h2>Why this didn't make sense to us</h2>

    <p>
      The land and build contracts are separate agreements. The land contract is
      strictly between us and the land developer, and the building contract is
      between us and the builder.
    </p>

    <p>
      We were also the only party required to sign this document, the land developer
      was not involved at all. This made the arrangement feel one-sided and unclear.
    </p>

    <p>
      What concerned us most was a clause stating:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      “Should the developer not make any payment of the invoice within 60 days,
      Celebration Homes will raise a variation to the contract charging the client
      the value of the rebate.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Our interpretation was that if the developer refused to pay the builder,
      the responsibility would fall back on us, even though we had no control
      over the developer's actions.
    </p>

    <p>
      This conflicted with our land contract, which already stated that the rebate
      would be deducted directly from the land settlement price.
    </p>

    <h2>Getting clarification</h2>

    <p>
      To understand what was going on, we emailed:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>The sales consultant, asking for a clear explanation</li>
      <li>Our mortgage broker, for an independent opinion</li>
      <li>The land developer, to check whether this arrangement was acceptable</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The sales consultant replied that:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      “It won't be applied on your building contract. Celebration Homes more want
      to have record that you'll be receiving the rebate from the developer.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      However, the document itself explicitly stated that it would be applied to
      the building contract, something our mortgage broker also highlighted.
      This inconsistency made us even more uncomfortable.
    </p>

    <h2>Our decision</h2>

    <p>
      After considering all feedback, we decided not to proceed with signing the document.
      We responded with the following:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      “Please treat the build and land contract separately.
      The rebate will be applied to the land settlement.
      We will not sign this document.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The builder cancelled the document, and we were not required to sign it.
    </p>

    <h2>Final thoughts</h2>

    <p>
      This experience reinforced how important it is for buyers to carefully read
      every document they are asked to sign, even if it appears administrative
      or routine.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some documents are not mandatory, and if something feels unclear or risky,
      it's okay to pause, seek advice, or decline. Legal advice is also an option
      if you're unsure.
    </p>

    <p>
      Taking the time to understand what you're agreeing to can prevent much bigger
      issues later on.
