    <p>
      On 20 August 2025, we had our first appointment with Celebration Homes. This
      meeting felt quite different from our previous display home visits, as it
      took place at their office in Leederville.
    </p>

    <h2>Meeting details</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Date:</strong> Wednesday, 20 August 2025</li>
      <li><strong>Time:</strong> 6:00 PM</li>
      <li><strong>Location:</strong> 301 Vincent Street, Leederville WA 6007</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Prior to the meeting, Celebration Homes sent us an outline of what would be
      covered. This helped set expectations and made the session feel structured
      and purposeful.
    </p>

    <h2>What the meeting covered</h2>

    <p>The discussion focused on:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Understanding what we were looking for in a new home</li>
      <li>Reviewing timelines and the overall building process</li>
      <li>Walking us through the Celebration Homes experience and support provided</li>
      <li>Discussing initial pricing estimates for different designs and land</li>
      <li>
        A tour of their <strong>Home Collective</strong> showroom to showcase
        specifications and features
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      We were encouraged to bring any ideas, documents, or questions, which made
      the meeting feel collaborative rather than sales-driven.
    </p>

    <h2>A different type of appointment</h2>

    <p>
      Compared to display home visits, this appointment felt more focused and
      personal. Being in their office environment allowed for a deeper discussion
      about how Celebration Homes operates as a builder.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because we already had our finance and land sorted, we were able to focus
      entirely on understanding the builder itself — their process, inclusions,
      and whether they would be the right fit for us.
    </p>

    <h2>Touring the Home Collective showroom</h2>

    <p>
      One of the highlights of the appointment was walking through their
      <strong>Home Collective</strong> showroom. This space allows you to see and
      feel the actual materials used in their builds.
    </p>

    <p>We were able to view and touch:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Benchtop materials</li>
      <li>Cabinetry finishes</li>
      <li>Cooktops and appliances</li>
      <li>Tiles</li>
      <li>Doors and internal finishes</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Being able to physically see and feel these materials made it much easier
      to understand what was included and how different options might look in a
      finished home.
    </p>

    <h2>What stood out</h2>

    <div class="callout">
      One thing that really stood out was the level of customisation available,
      supported by WA-based contractors.
    </div>

    <p>
      A key takeaway from this meeting was learning that Celebration Homes can
      customise certain designs more easily. Many of their contractors are
      WA-based, and they manufacture some components locally, such as cabinetry.
    </p>

    <p>
      This flexibility made the builder more appealing, as it opened up more
      options for tailoring a home to suit our needs rather than being locked
      into a rigid design.
    </p>

    <h2>After the appointment</h2>

    <p>
      By the end of the meeting, we had a much clearer understanding of what
      Celebration Homes could offer and how they might fit into our overall build
      journey.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was a productive session that helped us compare builders beyond just
      pricing and floor plans, and instead focus on process, quality, and
      flexibility.
