    <p>
      On 09 August 2025, we decided to visit another display village, this time
      north of Perth at the
      <a href="https://www.stockland.com.au/residential/wa/illyarrie" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
        Illyarrie estate
      </a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The goal of this visit was simple: look at what was available in this
      display village and compare how different builders approach their designs,
      layouts, and inclusions.
    </p>

    <h2>Exploring different builders and frontages</h2>

    <p>
      One thing we really liked about this visit was being able to see homes with
      different frontages. Walking through multiple homes back-to-back helped us
      understand how the same block width can feel very different depending on
      the design.
    </p>

    <p>
      We visited each of our shortlisted builders and also looked at display homes
      from Celebration Homes and Home Group. Seeing a variety of builders in one
      place made comparisons far easier than visiting them individually.
    </p>

    <h2>Seeing floor plans in real life</h2>

    <p>
      While floor plans on paper are useful, nothing compares to seeing room sizes
      in person. This visit helped us better understand:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>How different layouts affect flow through the home</li>
      <li>Actual room sizes compared to what they look like on plans</li>
      <li>How ceiling heights change the overall feel of a space</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Walking through the homes gave us a much clearer idea of what would work for
      our lifestyle and what wouldn’t.
    </p>

    <h2>Observing other buyers</h2>

    <p>
      While walking through the display village, we noticed a few other visitors
      speaking with consultants and asking questions about house and land pricing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many of them didn’t seem particularly prepared. They often had no clear idea
      of their budget, which areas they were interested in, how large a block they
      wanted, or whether they had finance in place.
    </p>

    <p>
      From our perspective, these conversations didn’t seem very productive. It
      reinforced how important preparation is before engaging with builders,
      especially when discussing pricing and feasibility.
    </p>

    <h2>How we approached the conversation</h2>

    <p>
      When we spoke with consultants, we took a different approach. We explained
      that:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>We had already spoken with our mortgage broker</li>
      <li>We were in the process of obtaining our Letter of Eligibility (LOE)</li>
      <li>We had a shortlist of floor plans we were interested in</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      We presented the floor plans we liked and asked specific questions around:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Pricing for each plan</li>
      <li>The cost of potential changes and upgrades</li>
      <li>What building inclusions were standard</li>
      <li>Estimated administration and pre-construction time</li>
      <li>Typical construction time from slab to handover</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Being prepared made a noticeable difference. The conversations were more
      detailed, practical, and tailored to our situation rather than generic.
    </p>

    <h2>What we took away from the visit</h2>

    <p>
      This visit helped validate some of our earlier assumptions and also raised
      new questions we hadn’t considered before. Seeing different builders side by
      side made it easier to narrow down what mattered most to us.
    </p>

    <p>
      Overall, it was another valuable step in our build journey and helped us
      feel more confident moving forward.
