    <p>
      By mid-January 2026, nothing had progressed with our pre-construction, even
      though everything had been planned months in advance. This was incredibly
      disappointing, especially given how clear and organised we had been with
      our timelines.
    </p>

    <p>
      On top of that, communication from the builder had been consistently
      disappointing. Follow-ups were slow, expectations weren't met, and there
      was little confidence that things would improve.
    </p>

    <h2>Deciding to move on</h2>
    <p>
      At this point, we made the decision to look for a different builder, one
      that aligned better with our top priority: <strong>clear and consistent
      communication</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We went back to researching builders that might be a better fit for us and
      remembered that we had previously missed a meeting with La Vida Homes due
      to unforeseen circumstances. This time, we wanted to properly explore
      them as an option.
    </p>

    <h2>Researching La Vida Homes</h2>
    <p>
      We spent time reviewing what <a href="https://lavidahomes.com.au/" target="_blank">La Vida Homes</a>
      had to offer, including their building inclusions, pricing, and overall
      approach.
    </p>

    <p>
      What immediately stood out was their transparency. Prices were clear,
      and their tiered inclusions model made it easy to understand what was
      included at each level and choose what suited our budget and needs.
    </p>

    <h2>Preparing before the meeting</h2>
    <p>
      We reviewed their available floor plans and shortlisted the designs that
      worked best for us. From there, we started redesigning certain areas to
      better suit our lifestyle so we could go into the meeting well prepared.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wanting to get a feel for how they operated, I booked a phone meeting
      directly through their website to speak with a sales consultant about our
      situation, timelines, and how their organisation runs builds.
    </p>

    <h2>A refreshing experience</h2>
    <p>
      From the very first interaction, the difference was noticeable. Our sales
      consultant communicated clearly, was well organised, straight to the
      point, and followed through on what was discussed.
    </p>

    <p>
      That alone gave us confidence that this builder could be a much better
      fit for us as first home builders.
