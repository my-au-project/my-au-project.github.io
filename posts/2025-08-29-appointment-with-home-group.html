    <p>
      On 29 August 2025, we had an appointment with Home Group. Learning from our
      previous builder appointments, we decided to prepare thoroughly before
      this meeting to ensure the discussion would be focused and productive.
    </p>

    <h2>Preparing before the meeting</h2>

    <p>
      Prior to the appointment, we sent Home Group a detailed email outlining our
      situation, intentions, and expectations. This allowed them to prepare
      pricing and information specific to our build rather than giving generic
      answers.
    </p>

    <p>
      At this stage, we had already received our <strong>Letter of Eligibility
      (LOE)</strong> and secured a block of land, with the title expected between
      March and April 2026.
    </p>

    <h3>Land requirements shared</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>BAL 12.5</li>
      <li>Noise Package B</li>
      <li>Soil Class S</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      We asked Home Group to provide estimates on how these requirements would
      impact the overall build cost.
    </p>

    <h2>Design and pricing requests</h2>

    <p>
      We were particularly interested in the <strong>Maldives design</strong> and
      asked for a cost breakdown across:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Standard specifications</li>
      <li>Designer Plus specifications</li>
      <li>Luxury specifications</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We also requested quotes for the following upgrades:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Wall painting</li>
      <li>Vinyl flooring to all rooms (no carpets)</li>
      <li>Additional 30 power points</li>
      <li>Additional 30 LED lights</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Questions about promotions</h2>

    <p>
      During a previous visit to a display home in Treeby, we noticed several
      promotional upgrades and wanted more clarity around them.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Aluminium front door and electronic smart lock</strong><br>
        – How long does the promotion run?
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Solar panels</strong><br>
        – Brand, panel size, battery inclusion, warranty, and specifications
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Booking the appointment</h2>

    <p>
      To make scheduling easy, we shared our availability upfront:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Friday, 29 August 2025 – from 5:00 PM</li>
      <li>Wednesday, 3 September 2025 – from 5:00 PM</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This approach allowed Home Group to prepare in advance, which made the
      discussion far smoother once we arrived.
    </p>

    <h2>Visiting the Home Group office and showroom</h2>

    <p>
      When we arrived at the Home Group office, we were impressed by their showroom,
      particularly the kitchens, which helped us better understand the finishes,
      inclusions, and promotional upgrades.
    </p>

    <h2>Discussing the build process</h2>

    <p>
      During the meeting, we went through:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Their overall build process</li>
      <li>Standard inclusions and upgrade options</li>
      <li>Current promotions</li>
      <li>Price breakdowns</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      We also discussed potential customisations, particularly around kitchen
      design and layout.
    </p>

    <h2>What we learned about customisation</h2>

    <div class="callout">
      Customisation costs depend heavily on where materials are manufactured.
    </div>

    <p>
      One important thing we learned was that some of Home Group’s materials and
      products are manufactured outside Australia. Because
      of this, certain designs come as standard.
    </p>

    <p>
      Customising these elements can cost extra, as changes may need to be
      manufactured locally rather than coming from their standard supply chain.
      This was an important insight when weighing flexibility versus cost.
    </p>

    <h2>Overall impression</h2>

    <p>
      This appointment felt very efficient and informative. Preparing ahead of
      time clearly paid off, as the discussion was tailored to our situation and
      focused on real numbers rather than assumptions.
    </p>

    <p>
      By the end of the meeting, we had a clearer understanding of Home Group’s
      offerings, strengths, and limitations, which helped us further narrow down
      our builder shortlist.
