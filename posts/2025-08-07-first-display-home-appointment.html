    <p>
      On 07 August 2025, we booked our very first display home appointment with
      Blueprint Homes at the new Treeby display village, located in the
      <a href="https://laketreeby.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
        Treeby estate
      </a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since this was our first ever builder appointment, we went in with one main
      goal: learn as much as possible about the building process.
    </p>

    <h2>Learning about display villages</h2>

    <p>
      One of the first things we learned was that a display home is usually part
      of a <strong>display village</strong>. That means multiple builders each
      have their own display homes within the same estate, which makes it easier
      to compare designs, inclusions, and build quality in one visit.
    </p>

    <h2>Meeting the consultant</h2>

    <p>
      We met our Blueprint Homes consultant and walked through the entire build
      journey, from start to finish. They provided us with a starter pack that
      covered a wide range of topics, including:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Finance and loan considerations</li>
      <li>Pre-construction and planning stages</li>
      <li>The construction process</li>
      <li>Finding and securing land</li>
      <li>Site works and potential costs</li>
      <li>Building inclusions</li>
      <li>First home buyer benefits and grants</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The importance of a Letter of Eligibility (LOE)</h2>

    <div class="callout">
      A Letter of Eligibility (LOE) is essential when placing a deposit on land.
      Without it, developers are unlikely to take you seriously.
    </div>

    <p>
      The consultant emphasised that when you’re ready to secure land, you’ll need
      a <strong>Letter of Eligibility (LOE)</strong>. This letter confirms that you
      have the borrowing capacity to finance the land purchase.
    </p>

    <p>
      Apparently, without an LOE, developers may not even proceed with discussions.
      Fortunately for us, we were already in the process of obtaining one from the
      very beginning.
    </p>

    <h2>Discussing floor plans and pricing</h2>

    <p>
      We already had a shortlist of floor plans we liked, so we shared those with
      the consultant and asked for rough pricing. Our aim was to understand:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Base build cost</li>
      <li>Estimated site works</li>
      <li>Additional upgrades we were considering</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Some of the upgrades we asked about included painting, 31c ceiling heights
      throughout the home, and other commonly upgraded inclusions.
    </p>

    <h2>Walking through the display home</h2>

    <p>
      After the discussion, the consultant walked us through the display home and
      pointed out key features such as:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Ceiling heights and overall spatial feel</li>
      <li>Kitchen layout and flow</li>
      <li>Stone benchtops</li>
      <li>Cabinetry finishes and storage solutions</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Seeing these elements in person helped us better understand what inclusions
      actually look and feel like, rather than just reading them on a brochure.
    </p>

    <h2>After the appointment</h2>

    <p>
      We left the appointment feeling far more informed and confident about the
      process. It was reassuring to get real, practical information directly from
      a builder.
    </p>

    <p>
      The following day, the consultant emailed us detailed pricing for the floor
      plans we requested, including site works and the additional upgrades we had
      discussed.
    </p>

    <p>
      This gave us our first realistic idea of what building could actually cost
      and helped set expectations for the next stages of our journey.
