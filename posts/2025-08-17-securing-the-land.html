    <p>
      After deciding on the block we wanted, the next step was officially securing
      the land. This was a major milestone in our journey and the point where
      everything started to feel real.
    </p>

    <h2>Providing our Letter of Eligibility (LOE)</h2>
    <p>
      The first document the developer asked for was our
      <strong>Letter of Eligibility (LOE)</strong>. This shows our potential
      borrowing power and gives the developer confidence that we are financially
      capable of proceeding with the purchase.
    </p>

    <p>
      While it isn’t a formal loan approval, it was sufficient for the developer
      to move forward with preparing the land contract.
    </p>

    <h2>Information requested by the developer</h2>
    <p>
      To prepare the land contract, the developer’s sales consultant asked us to
      provide several details and documents.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Passport or driver’s licence for identification</li>
      <li>Full legal names of all buyers (as per ID)</li>
      <li>Current residential address</li>
      <li>Email addresses for all buyers</li>
      <li>Mobile numbers for all buyers</li>
      <li>Confirmation of the lot number we wished to purchase</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Once all information was confirmed, the contract preparation process began.
    </p>

    <h2>Signing the land contract</h2>
    <p>
      The sales consultant sent us the land contract electronically via
      <strong>DocuSign</strong>. This made the process straightforward and allowed
      us to review and sign the documents without needing to attend an office.
    </p>

    <p>
      We were advised that once the seller accepted the contract, the next step
      would be transferring the deposit to formally secure the land.
    </p>

    <h2>Paying the deposit</h2>
    <p>
      After receiving confirmation that the seller had accepted the contract,
      we arranged the deposit transfer as instructed. This step officially
      secured the land and removed it from the market.
    </p>

    <div class="callout">
      Paying the deposit was the moment it truly felt locked in.
    </div>

    <h2>Contract completed</h2>
    <p>
      After all administrative checks and processing were completed, we received
      the fully executed land contract. At this point, the land was officially
      secured, subject to settlement.
    </p>

    <p>
      With the land locked in, we could confidently move forward with builder
      selection and detailed design, knowing we had a solid foundation in place.
