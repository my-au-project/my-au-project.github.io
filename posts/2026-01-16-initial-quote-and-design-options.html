      <h2>Key takeaways</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>We discussed our requirements, preferred designs, and requested pricing.</li>
        <li>The consultant provided a formal quote with multiple specification tiers.</li>
        <li>We received floor plans and supporting documents to review.</li>
        <li>We decided to move forward and book an in-office appointment.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <p>
      Following our phone meeting with the consultant, we went through what we were
      looking for in a home, the designs we were interested in, and asked for price
      guidance to help us understand our options.
    </p>

    <p>
      Later that day, the consultant sent through pricing along with supporting
      documentation. This included a PDF copy of the floor plan, the different
      specification tiers, and other related documents to review in our own time.
    </p>

    <p>
      The pricing was based on the <strong>Swerve 12.5</strong> design for
      our land with titles expected around
      March - May 2026.
    </p>

    <p>
      The quote noted that pricing did not include any future changes to the plan or
      any required design guideline adjustments, should those be needed later.
    </p>

    <p>
      Overall, we were happy with the information provided and felt comfortable
      progressing to the next step. We asked to book an office appointment to go
      through more details about the company, inclusions, pricing structure, and
      expected timelines.
