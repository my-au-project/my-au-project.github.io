    <!-- KEY TAKEAWAYS -->
    <section class="key-takeaways">
      <h2>Key takeaways</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Start looking for land as soon as your borrowing capacity is clear.</li>
        <li>Use both developer websites and land marketplaces.</li>
        <li>Shortlist blocks early to compare true costs.</li>
        <li>Price per square metre matters more than headline price.</li>
        <li>Hidden factors like BAL, noise, and soil can impact build costs.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <p>
      Once we had a clear idea of how much we could borrow, the next step was
      finding the right block of land. This stage required more research and
      patience than we initially expected.
    </p>

    <h2>Where we looked</h2>
    <p>
      There are many websites where you can check land availability and pricing.
      Major developers usually have their own platforms showing current and
      upcoming estates.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Developer websites (for example, Satterley)</li>
      <li>Land marketplaces such as wegotland.com.au</li>
      <li>Home builders that offer land-finding services</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Shortlisting our options</h2>

    <p>
      After identifying several blocks we liked, we listed land options across
      the areas we were genuinely considering living in. From there, we created
      a shortlist so we could compare them side by side rather than making
      decisions in isolation.
    </p>

    <p>Our shortlisting criteria included:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Amenities available (schools, shops, parks, transport)</li>
      <li>Distance to work and overall commute time</li>
      <li>Land size and how usable the block would be</li>
      <li>Price per square metre, not just the total land price</li>
      <li>
        Additional factors that could increase build costs, such as:
        <ul>
          <li>BAL (Bushfire Attack Level) ratings</li>
          <li>Noise ratings</li>
          <li>Soil classifications</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Some blocks looked appealing at first, but once we considered these
      additional requirements, they became less attractive due to the potential
      impact on our overall build budget.
    </p>

    <p>
      Taking the time to properly shortlist helped us avoid surprises later and
      made the final decision feel far more confident.
    </p>

    <h2>Working with a builder</h2>
    <p>
      We initially asked a home consultant to help us secure land. While this
      option was convenient, the process wasn’t as quick as we wanted it to be.
    </p>

    <div class="callout">
      Land can move quickly in popular estates, so timing and responsiveness
      matter.
    </div>

    <h2>Contacting the developer directly</h2>
    <p>
      To speed things up, we contacted the developer ourselves to inquire about
      availability. This gave us clearer answers and allowed us to act quickly
      when the right block became available.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once we found a lot we were happy with, we were able to place a hold on the
      land by paying a deposit, which gave us confidence to move forward.
