    <!-- KEY TAKEAWAYS -->
    <section class="key-takeaways">
      <h2>Key takeaways</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Research builders early, especially if it’s your first build.</li>
        <li>Online reviews and community feedback are valuable but should be balanced.</li>
        <li>Communication was our top priority when choosing a builder.</li>
        <li>Inclusions, pricing, and timelines vary significantly between builders.</li>
        <li>Visiting display homes helped us narrow our shortlist.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <p>
      Since we hadn’t built a home before, choosing the right builder felt like
      one of the most important decisions we would make. We didn’t have prior
      experience to rely on, so we started by doing as much research as we could.
    </p>

    <h2>Our research process</h2>
    <p>
      We spent a lot of time reading through other people’s experiences online.
      This included browsing forums, reviews, and community discussions to get
      a sense of how different builders operated once contracts were signed.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Reddit discussions</li>
      <li>Facebook groups and comments</li>
      <li>ProductReview.com.au</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      While we took individual comments with a grain of salt, patterns started
      to emerge — especially around communication, delays, and build quality.
    </p>

    <h2>What we were looking for in a builder</h2>
    <p>
      To help narrow things down, we listed our key requirements and compared
      builders against them.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Communication</strong><br>
        Our number one priority. We wanted a builder that would keep us informed
        throughout the build and clearly communicate any changes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Building inclusions</strong><br>
        Builders offer very different base inclusions. We compared what was
        included and what would cost extra.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Price</strong><br>
        The build needed to stay within our budget without compromising on
        quality.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Floor plans</strong><br>
        Our land could fit a 12.5m frontage, so we wanted a good range of designs
        that suited our lifestyle.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Admin timeframe</strong><br>
        How long planning, design, and approvals would take before construction
        started.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Build time</strong><br>
        Estimated time from slab down to handover.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Narrowing it down</h2>
    <p>
      After comparing all our options, we shortlisted four builders that best
      aligned with our priorities.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our next step was to visit their display homes to get a better feel for
      the build quality, materials used, layouts, and overall finish.
    </p>

    <div class="callout">
      Display homes helped us visualise layouts and finishes far better than
      brochures or floor plans ever could.
    </div>

    <p>
      Walking through the homes gave us a clearer idea of room sizes, natural
      light, storage, and how the spaces would actually feel day to day.
