    <p>
      On this date, we received an invitation to register for the builder's
      <strong>Building Hub</strong> portal. This is an online system designed to
      centralise information throughout pre-construction and construction.
    </p>

    <h2>What the Building Hub provides</h2>

    <p>
      The portal allows us to:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>See progress through pre-construction and construction, explained in non-technical terms</li>
      <li>Download shared documents such as plans, contracts, and specifications</li>
      <li>View photos taken at construction milestones</li>
      <li>Read FAQs covering elements that may not be familiar to first-time builders</li>
      <li>Find contact details for the people responsible for different stages of the build</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Itemised selections and pricing</h2>

    <p>
      One of the most useful features was the ability to see itemised selections
      and pricing across almost every part of the home. This included areas such as:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Bricklaying works and face brick selection</li>
      <li>Roofing, plumbing, gutters, fascia, and render</li>
      <li>Fixing carpentry, robes, pantry, linen, and storage</li>
      <li>Paving, garage doors, windows, sliding doors, and privacy glazing</li>
      <li>External and internal doors, handles, and hardware</li>
      <li>Main flooring, vinyl planks, carpets, and underlay</li>
      <li>Kitchen benchtops, cabinetry, handles, splashbacks, and appliances</li>
      <li>Wet area tiles, sanitary fittings, and bathroom fixtures</li>
      <li>Electrical selections including downlights, pendants, and external lighting</li>
      <li>Consultations for home technology, air conditioning, and solar</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Being able to see prices for each item made it easier to understand how
      individual choices impacted the overall budget. It also allowed us to plan
      ahead by adding or removing items before finalising selections.
    </p>

    <h2>3D exterior visualisation</h2>

    <p>
      The portal also included a 3D exterior model of the house. This allowed us
      to preview changes such as:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Roof colour</li>
      <li>Brick colour</li>
      <li>Windows and window frame colours</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      While this was very helpful for visualising the external look of the home,
      it was limited to exterior elements only. Internal items such as doors,
      tapware, cabinetry, showerheads, and fittings were not included in the 3D view.
    </p>

    <h2>Overall impression</h2>

    <p>
      Despite the limitations on interior visualisation, the Building Hub was a
      useful tool for planning and budgeting. Having everything in one place made
      it easier to understand what we were selecting, how much each choice cost,
      and how the build was progressing.
    </p>

    <p>
      For us, this portal helped bring clarity to what can otherwise feel like an
      overwhelming number of decisions during pre-construction.
