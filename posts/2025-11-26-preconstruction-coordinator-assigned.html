    <p>
      On this date, we were finally allocated a
      <strong>Customer Experience Coordinator</strong> for our pre-construction
      journey. By this point, it had been almost three months since we paid our
      deposit.
    </p>

    <p>
      This was the first time we had a clearly defined point of contact whose role
      was specifically focused on guiding us through the pre-construction phase.
    </p>

    <h2>What pre-construction involves</h2>

    <p>
      The coordinator explained that pre-construction is the stage where all the
      groundwork is completed to prepare the home for construction. This includes:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Finalising the building contracts</li>
      <li>Securing council approvals</li>
      <li>Preparing documents, drawings, and specifications for the site</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      While construction itself is the most visible stage, this phase is where
      many of the critical decisions and administrative tasks happen behind the scenes.
    </p>

    <h2>Ongoing communication and support</h2>

    <p>
      The coordinator outlined her role as keeping us informed, guiding us through
      upcoming steps, and answering questions as they arise. She also mentioned
      that she would check in with us on a <strong>fortnightly basis</strong> to
      provide updates and keep us involved.
    </p>

    <p>
      We were asked to confirm our preferred communication method via phone, email,
      or a combination of both to make sure updates worked around our availability.
    </p>

    <h2>Upcoming consultations</h2>

    <p>
      During pre-construction, we were advised to expect several key consultations:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Design Brief (1.5 hours)</strong> — A session with an expert
        consultant to discuss our vision, style, and options, guided through the
        selection centre.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Electrical & Technology Consultation (2 hours)</strong> — Covering
        electrical layout, smart technology, air conditioning, and solar selections.
        This can be booked once the HIA contract is signed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Selections Consultation</strong> — The final product and colour
        selection meeting at Home Collective. Five hours are allocated, but it’s
        recommended to keep the whole day free. This is also booked after signing
        the HIA contract.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Travel plans and timing</h2>

    <p>
      The coordinator acknowledged that we would be out of the country from the
      end of February through all of March and asked us to flag any finance-related
      deadlines that might be affected by this timing.
    </p>

    <p>
      We were also advised that additional information about what to expect during
      pre-construction would be uploaded to the <strong>Building Hub</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>Our thoughts at this stage</h2>

    <p>
      Having a dedicated coordinator brought some clarity to what had previously
      felt like a slow and uncertain phase. While there was still a lot to be done,
      it helped to finally understand the structure of pre-construction and what
      steps were meant to come next.
    </p>

    <p>
      At this point, we were hopeful that progress would start to feel more tangible
      with clearer communication and defined milestones.
