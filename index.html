  <h2>About this site</h2>
  <p id="about-text" class="about-text"> 
    We're first home builders and wanted to share what our build process has
    actually been like. Not the polished marketing version, but the real one.
  <br>
  <br>

 
    Building a home has been very imperfect and very long. It's a roller coaster
    of emotions: excitement, anxiety, disappointment, and everything in between.
  <br>
  <br>

 
    <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Everything shared on this site is based on our
    real, personal experience. It may or may not be the same experience for
    everyone else.
  <br>
  <br>

 
    One of the reasons we created this site is because we didn't have anyone
    recently who could walk us through the build process from a buyer's
    perspective, start to finish. No close friends or family we could sit down
    with and ask, “What was it really like?”
  <br>
  <br>

 
    Hopefully, having a place to read about our journey helps someone who's in
    the same position we were, building for the first time without much
    firsthand guidance.
  <br>
  <br>

 
    The posts here are written in timeline order. I started creating this site in
    <strong>February 2026</strong>, so I had to go back through emails and
    documents to capture past events accurately.
  <br>
  <br>

 
    This site simply documents our personal experience. It doesn't provide financial advice, and it isn't intended to criticise or promote any builder, only to share what happened from our point of view.
  <br>
  <br>

 
    I'm always happy to talk more about any part of the process. If you have
    questions or want to chat, feel free to reach out via email below.
  <br>
  <br>

 
    There is also a builder referral offer of <strong>$1,000 AUD</strong> if I
    refer you. If you choose to use it, we'll split it evenly at slab down <strong>($500 each)</strong>, so we both benefit. This is completely optional;
    you can absolutely contact builders directly if you prefer.
  <br>
  <br>

 
    I aim to post significant events on weekends close to when they happen, so
    feel free to bookmark this site. You can also follow along on Instagram where
    we document the build and where you can message me directly.
  <br>
  <br>

 
    You may notice the site uses a <strong>github.io</strong> domain, this is GitHub
    Pages, a free static website hosting service provided by GitHub.
